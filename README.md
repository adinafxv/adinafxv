- 👋 Hi, I’m @adinafxv, a Product Designer!
- 👀 I’m interested in the idea of Second Brain, keeping effective notes that promote further thinking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use new tools, as I haven‘t actively developed for a few years. I‘d like to come up with a simple workflow that will allow me to simply deploy selected notes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on short-time projects to support causes like: mental health awareness, endometriosis awareness and research, internet literacy & privacy awareness
