- 👋 Hi, I’m @adinafxv,
- 💻 I design digital products, but I also love working on service design and brands.
- 👀 I’m interested in the idea of Second Brain, keeping effective notes that promote further thinking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use new tools, as I haven‘t actively developed for a few years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on short-time projects to support causes like: mental health awareness, endometriosis awareness and research, internet literacy & privacy awareness
